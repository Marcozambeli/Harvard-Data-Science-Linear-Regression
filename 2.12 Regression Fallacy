#Code
#The code to create a table with player ID, their names, and their most played position:
library(Lahman)
playerInfo <- Fielding %>%
    group_by(playerID) %>%
    arrange(desc(G)) %>%
    slice(1) %>%
    ungroup %>%
    left_join(Master, by="playerID") %>%
    select(playerID, nameFirst, nameLast, POS)
#The code to create a table with only the ROY award winners and add their batting statistics:
ROY <- AwardsPlayers %>%
    filter(awardID == "Rookie of the Year") %>%
    left_join(playerInfo, by="playerID") %>%
    rename(rookie_year = yearID) %>%
    right_join(Batting, by="playerID") %>%
    mutate(AVG = H/AB) %>%
    filter(POS != "P")
#The code to keep only the rookie and sophomore seasons and remove players who did not play sophomore seasons:
ROY <- ROY %>%
    filter(yearID == rookie_year | yearID == rookie_year+1) %>%
    group_by(playerID) %>%
    mutate(rookie = ifelse(yearID == min(yearID), "rookie", "sophomore")) %>%
    filter(n() == 2) %>%
    ungroup %>%
    select(playerID, rookie_year, rookie, nameFirst, nameLast, AVG)
#The code to use the spread function to have one column for the rookie and sophomore years batting averages:
ROY <- ROY %>% spread(rookie, AVG) %>% arrange(desc(rookie))
ROY
